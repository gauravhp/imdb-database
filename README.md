This is a small application that I created using Java, Angular Js and H2.

It fetches the list of Webseries seasons/episodes from http://www.omdbapi.com 

Once you have them, you can store your favorites by choosing them.

The list of favorites is available on the next page. This list is persisted in the DB.
