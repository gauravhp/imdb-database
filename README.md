My solution to create an imdb listing with feature to select favorite episodes

Solved as the part of an interview test

The task is to create a web app, which allows a user to list all the episodes of their favorite
show for a specific season, and bookmark some of those episodes. For example, if you like GOT then
you can display all the episodes for season 3 and select the ones you like. The web app consist of two
sections:

● The first section lists all the episodes for a specific season.
● The second section consists of all the episodes selected/bookmarked from the first list. Note:
this list should survive page refresh.
● Bonus: Login and authentication!

Hint: you can use OMDB http://www.omdbapi.com

Rules:
● It is up to you to display the list of episodes, in either list, in any way you like. There's no
preference here regarding styling or UI.
● You can use any languages, toolkits, libraries, or stack overflow posts you wish. Whatever
makes your life easier. (FYIT he main part of our stack is React, Java Spring, MySQL.)
● There's no preference in how you store the second list of bookmarked episodes. It's preferred to
have a simple backend to store the episodes, in a file or SQLite database. The choice of
backend language/framework is up to you.
● Have the web app live on the internet for easy reviewing.
● Create a public GitHub public repo and share the link with upon completion.
